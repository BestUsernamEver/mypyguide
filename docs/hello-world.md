# Hello World

## Replit

Let's begin! Before we start, I want to let you know we will be using [*Replit*](https://replit.com) to code. If you don't have an account, I highly suggest you make one! (It's easy, I'll show you.)

* First, click the link above or enter `replit.com` in your search bar.

* Then, click `Sign In` and create your username and password or sign in with another app. 

> Signing in with Github is a great option for learning how to manage code and collaborating with other programmers by the way. If you want to look into that in the future, make sure to tell me!

* Make your account and click the bright button to the left labeled `Create Repl`.

* Select the Python template and name your new program. Click `Create Repl` again and we are ready to begin!

## Statements

### Print 

Now that you've created your first program, it's time to type your first line of code.

```py
print("Hello world!")
```

Congratulations! Now hit `Run`. That was a bit underwhelming, but you communicated with the terminal by telling it to say something to you. By using the term, `print()`, you made that happen! However, we also want to respond to the terminal. Let's try a second line of code under that previous line.

### Input

```py
input("What's your name? ")
```

In this line, we use the term `input()` which allows you to type something in the terminal. So type your name and press Enter.

> Notice how you can enter different types of input as well, whether it be letters, numbers, or symbols.

## Formatting

### New Line

If you've been experimenting a bit with `print()` and `input()`, you'll notice how cluttered it may seem to relay that much information on the terminal in such a small space. That's where formatting come in. One formatting tool used in Python are `\n`.

```py
print("Hello world!") # First line
input("What's your name? \n" ) # Second line
```

### Indent

Let's add a new line that lets the terminal respond back, and use another formatting tool: `\t`

```py
print("My name is Terminal. \t Nice to meet you!")
```

It's important to remember the **syntax** (*fancy word for grammar*) of Python because the order and spelling of certain terms can change the result of the program. For example, try changing the location of the formatting tools and see how the output is affected.
